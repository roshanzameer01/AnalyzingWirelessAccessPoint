# Analyzing Wireless Access Points

## üéØ Objective
In this project, I explored wireless network security by identifying rogue access points (APs) using tools like `netsh` and `InSSIDer`. Understanding the significance of rogue APs, assessing potential security risks, and evaluating the limitations of these tools in a practical setting.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
- **Netsh**: Command-line utility for managing network configurations on Windows.
- **InSSIDer**: Wireless network scanner providing a graphical representation of nearby networks.

## üß† Skills Learned
- Understood wireless network security and the role of rogue APs.
- Used command-line tools to gather detailed network information.
- Employed graphical tools for network analysis.
- Identified security threats posed by rogue APs.
- Recognized tool limitations in detecting and locating rogue APs.

### 1. Preparation
- Installed **InSSIDer** on my computer.
- Used Command Prompt or PowerShell with administrative rights to use `netsh`.
- Reviewed fundamental `netsh` commands for exploring wireless networks.
- Understood the project objectives.

### 2. Observation
- Compared the usability and data detail between `netsh` and InSSIDer.
- Recognized the importance of signal strength in identifying rogue APs using InSSIDer.

### 3. Using Netsh
#### Exploring the Wireless Environment
Execute the following command to display active wireless networks with their details:

```sh
netsh wlan show networks mode=bssid
